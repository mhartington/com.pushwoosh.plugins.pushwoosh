Pushwoosh SDK for Phonegap/Cordova CLI
===============================

Pushwoosh CLI setup

intergration of the Pushwoosh skd through Cordova/Phonegap CLI plugin install

To install:

$cordova plugin add https://github.com/mhartington/com.pushwoosh.plugins.pushwoosh.git


To remove:
$ cordova plugin rm com.pushwoosh.plugins.pushwoosh

This is just a test of automatic intergration via the command line interface. 

These include everything needed to add push notifications from pushwoosh except for the index.js (as named on their github) which changes on ios and android. 
Download a copy of those .js files and change them to fit your needs
